This website is a personal portfolio I designed and built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques. I focused on creating a clean, modern interface that showcases my skills, projects, and background in both computer science and UX/UI design. I used animations, a mobile-friendly layout, and visual elements created with tools like Canva and Photoshop to deliver a professional and engaging user experience.
