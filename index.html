    <section id="Self-introduction" class="container">
        <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Thinh Long Hua,
          and I am currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Science & Business at Cascadia College.
          I have a passion for both technology and creative communication,
          and I enjoy working in environments that allow me to connect with people from different backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve gained experience in customer service, event coordination, and graphic design
          supporting students during orientation to designing promotional materials for campus events.
          I'm also fluent in English and Vietnamese, which has helped me bridge communication gaps and contribute to diverse teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a quick learner, a strong team player, and someone who genuinely enjoys helping others.
          Whether itâ€™s through solving a technical challenge or creating an engaging design, 
          I aim to make a positive impact wherever I go.
        </p>

    <!--Academic Journey-->
    <section id="Academic-journey" class="container">
        <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My academic journey began in Toronto, Canada, where I graduated from John Polanyi Collegiate Institute in 2022. 
          During high school, I built a strong foundation in communication, teamwork, 
          and cultural awareness through both classroom learning and extracurricular involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fall of 2022, I continued my education at Cascadia College in Bothell, Washington, where Iâ€™m currently pursuing an Associate Degree
          in Computer Science & Business (expected graduation: June 2025). This program has allowed me to explore my interests at the intersection of technology and business, 
          equipping me with skills in programming (Java, Python, HTML), graphic design, and project coordination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the classroom, Iâ€™ve actively contributed to the campus community. 
          From leading event promotions and creating marketing materials for cultural events,
          to assisting new student orientation as a bilingual guide,
          Iâ€™ve developed both technical and interpersonal skills. My academic journey has not only deepened my knowledge,
          but also shaped me into a motivated, collaborative, and globally minded learner.
